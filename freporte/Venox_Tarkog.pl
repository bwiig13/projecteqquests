Together they can be coded and tell something of value. Antonius Bayle had them created and gave them to three of his most trusted friends. Of these I know, Lady Shae his old love. Then there is Captain Linarius Grafe, captain of the outer Qeynos Guards. Lastly there is Frenway Marthank, Antonius Bayle's oldest friend. He is a resident of the Jaggedpine. When you recover the scrolls you must take them to Rathmana Allin. He is a master scribe. He will decode the scrolls for us. He can be found in deserts of South Ro. Now you best be off, before some other finds the scrolls. You must get there first and return the decoded list to Pietro Zarn.");
