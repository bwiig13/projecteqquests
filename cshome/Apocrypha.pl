# Basic Design
# EoM (Server-Wide) buffs work by three methods;
# 1) Send a worldwide client signal, global_player catches it and applies the requested buffs
# 2) Set a bucket value with a 4 hour expiration.
# 3) Zone and Login methods in global_player apply the requested buffs with the requested durations

my $duration_override = 900; #set this value to override 'regular' buffs duration
