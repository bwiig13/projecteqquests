# Find Apoc quest

findapocquests finds rose colored and apoc variant item IDs based on findapocdb, and reports outliers

- It was made for checking for summonitem() events that need to be rose colored or normals.
- duplicate.txt is generated for items that have duplicate ID ranges on a single name
- missing.txt generates a list of item id's that don't have rose colored or apoc variants.
- good.txt generates a list of item id's that are "good"
